<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>
    When I started working on Mika, I decided to do a complete lighting overhaul. In exteriors, the light from the sun helped give
    volume to the world. However, in interiors or largely occluded areas there was no lighting information. Everything had an unlit appearance
    and the shaders didn't support additional lights. The first two changes were:
    <ul>
        <li>Added support for point and spot lights with shadow casting capabilities.</li>
        <li>Added a custom SSAO implementation.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    This improved the game's appearance and allowed us to make more appealing interiors. But there is a catch, which is that each MeshRenderer
    can only be affected by four additional lights at the same time. Since these lighting features were implemented after the game world had been
    modelled, many meshes occupied a very large space of the world, which makes placing lights without exceeding the limit hard.
</p>

<p>
    We needed a solution to this problem that didn't require remodelling the entire island just to add some fill lights. This is where decal lights
    and shadows come into action.

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>
    Decals can be applied in a deferred fashion, so that they only affect the pixels that they're drawn onto instead of an entire mesh.
    This is the key to render fake lights and shadows:

    <ul>
        <li>
            Decal Lights: render spheres and multiply the scene color (DstColor) by the light color (SrcColor) based on its distance to the
            center of the sphere.
        </li>
        <li>
            Decal Shadows: render cubes and blend the scene color (DstColor) with a shadow color (SrcColor) based on height along the cube (local
            y axis).
        </li>
    </ul>

</p>

<p>Decal shadows use the typical transparency formula:</p>

<div class="code">Blend SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha</div>

<p>Meanwhile, decal lights use a different formula to intensify the scene color based on the shader output:</p>

<div class="code">Blend DstColor One</div>

<p>
    In both cases, the shader must be configured so that it doesn't write to the depth buffer,
    front faces are culled and back faces are only rendered when they are behing geometry:
</p>

<div class="code">ZTest GEqual
Cull Front
ZWrite Off
</div>

<p>
    If you have difficulty understanding what these settings mean, see the image below. In yellow, 
    you can see the part of a sphere that would be visible when it intersects with geometry.
</p>

    "images": ["Articles/Mika_DecalLights/DecalVisualization.png"]
    , "maximizable": false
}'></div>

<p>
    Using the depth buffer and some mathematics, it is possible to reconstruct the world position inside of the decal and use it to calculate
    its opacity.
</p>

<p>
    How to get the local y axis inside the cube for decal shadows (height):
</p>

<div class="code" data-lang="hlsl">float rawDepth =  SampleSceneDepth(screenUV);
float3 positionWS = ComputeWorldSpacePosition(screenUV, rawDepth, UNITY_MATRIX_I_VP);
half3 positionOS = TransformWorldToObject(positionWS);
half3 absPositionOS = abs(positionOS);
half maxCoord = max(absPositionOS.x, max(absPositionOS.y, absPositionOS.z));
clip(-maxCoord+0.5);
float height = positionOS.y + 0.5;
</div>

<p>
    How to calculate the distance to the sphere center for decal point lights (distSqr):
</p>

<div class="code" data-lang="hlsl">float2 screenUV = input.screenPos.xy / input.screenPos.w;
float rawDepth = SampleSceneDepth(screenUV);
float3 positionWS = ComputeWorldSpacePosition(screenUV, rawDepth, UNITY_MATRIX_I_VP);
half3 positionOS = TransformWorldToObject(positionWS);

half3 dir = positionOS;
half distSqr = dot(dir, dir);
clip(1.0-distSqr);

half atten = LightingDistanceAttenuation(distSqr, 1.0);
</div>

<p>
    The game uses the stencil buffer to separate different layers, like water and characters. How this is
    implemented is out of scope for this article but you can see the code in the last section
    if you're interested. Thanks to the stencil buffer, it is possible to make decal lights exclude
    the player or water.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
    
<p>
    Decal lights and shadows are limitied to simple height gradients and fill light spheres without shadows, but together
    with a few actual lights and ambient occlusion, they can make environments a lot more appealing.
    These faked lights and shadows are used to great extent in interiors in the game, especially in the dungeons.

<h3>Going Forward</h3>
    

<p>
    There is so much more that can be done with decals when it comes to lighting. For this game I really didn't have
    the time to delve into it, but here are some ideas that come to mind on how to take this lighting system further:

    <ul>
        <li>Create shadow decals that can project a silhouette onto the ground. Potentially, allow that silhouette to be 
        dynamic and rendered on demand. This could be used for detailed character shadows using decals.</li>
        <li>Create decal lights that can shape different shapes, like directional, area and spot lights.</li>
        <li>Add support for static shadows to decal lights using prerendered shadow maps.</li>
        <li>Add angle attenuation to decal lights, using scene normals or infering normals from the 
        depth buffer.</li>
        <li>Add better controls to how decals affect characters or other layers.</li>
        <li>Create decal lights that add only specular highlights. This could be useful for scenes 
        that use baked lighting. Using these specular decals, artists could add specularity to metals
        exactly where they want, without changing the lighting of the scene.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Complete shaders</h3>

<p>
    Take into account that there are also some C# scripts to manage lighting properties using material property blocks.
