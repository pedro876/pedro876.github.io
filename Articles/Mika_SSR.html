<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>When it comes to water rendering, there is a physical characteristic that I consider 
    crucial to achieve convincing results, and that is reflections. However, there are
    several ways to achieve this in real-time. The first and arguably easiest approach is 
    using reflection probes. How many reflections probes would be required to achieve
    good results in an open world like Mika? A lot, and we were already short on memory
    budget. The ideal technique to solve this issue is raytracing, but that's not supported 
    on all platforms and is really expensive. So, my best bet was using a screen-space 
    solution.</p>

<p>During the PS4-era many games introduced Screen-Space Reflections (SSR) as a way
    to render reflections in real-time very efficiently. Of course, there are caviats
    to this technique, namely:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Anything outside the frustrum is undefined, it can't be integrated into the scene.</li>
    <li>Any surface that is occluded by another is also not available.</li>
    <li>The depth buffer is used to determine collisions against surfaces, so transparent
    objects won't be present in reflections.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this game, we just needed reflections in water, so I implemented SSR with that in mind.</p>
