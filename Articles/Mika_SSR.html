<h3>Motivation</h3>
    
<p>
    In modern computer graphics, achieving realistic reflections is crucial for creating
    visually convincing water. However, in the context of more stylized o cartoonish games, this is
    not always the case. By the time of release, Mika and the Witch's Mountain had no reflections
    on any surface, but I always wondered whether water would benefit from this effect or not.
    There was only one way to find out: test it.
</p>

<p>
    Up until this point, I had a lot of experience using reflection probes and had toyed a bit with ray tracing.
    Sadly, these techniques were not applicable for this game. We couldn't populate the world
    with dozens of baked probes because that would require a lot of memory, both on disk and 
    during runtime.

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Reflection probes</b>: Require too much memory both on disk and during runtime. Besides, dynamic objects can't be reflected (if baked);
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Ray-Traced reflections</b>: A RTAS (Ray Tracing Acceleration Structure) must be constructed and nothing 
        had been modeled or shaded with that in mind.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In the end, I decided to learn something new and implement <b>Screen-Space Reflections</b>. This technique was widely used 
    during the PS4 era and is still very relevant today. It has many <b>positive aspects</b>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Does not consume additional memory if an opaque buffer was already available.</li>
    <li>Achieves high quality reflections at a very reasonable cost.</li>
    <li>Results are correctly aligned with the camera's perspective.</li>
</ul>

<p>The technique has its <b>downsides</b> too:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Anything outside the frustrum, and thus outside the screen space, can't be reflected.</li>
    <li>Any surface that is occluded can't be traced against.</li>
    <li>Can give a feeling of instability or pop-in in motion.</li>
</ul>
