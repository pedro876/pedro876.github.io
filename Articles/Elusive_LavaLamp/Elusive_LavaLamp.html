<h1>Lava lamp</h1>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

In a world where you are a very small creature inside a human 
house, how you interact with ordinary decoration elements becomes very important.
We were looking for interesting objects to add some motion and style to 
a very static scene. For this project in particular, <i>It Takes Two</i> was a 
very important reference and a very cool effect got my attention: The lava lamp.
