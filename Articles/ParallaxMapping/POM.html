<h4>Curved Relief Mapping</h4>

<p>
    Parallax mapping assumes a planar representation for each pixel. When the effect is presented with
    high displacement offsets on non planar meshes, you start to see the limitations of this technique. As the ray progresses through the 
    surface, it should actually bend following the surface curvature, but we don't have the geometric information 
    required to do that in a fragment shader. Besides, even if we did have the mesh data required to achieve that, 
    it would probably be too expensive.
</p>

<p>
    One way to overcome this problem, is to mathematically approximate the curvature. This is what <b>Manuel M. Oliveira</b>
    tried in his 2005 paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237284965_An_Efficient_Representation_for_Surface_Details">
    An Efficient Representation for Surface Details</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The idea is to do a preprocessing step of the mesh to obtain two coeficients that define a quadric surface for each vertex, 
    and store it as an attribute. During raymarching, the quadric surface height is calculated using the curvature coeficients and
    the ray displacement. This leads to a situation in which a ray may enter the surface, and exit it without colliding against 
    the height map. In that case, the pixel is considered to belong to a silhouette and is therefore discarded.

<p>
    Don't get too excited though. In theory, this should improve the look of parallax effects significantly and provide accurate silhouettes.
    However, in practice, <b>I found out that this approximation breaks even in simple test cases</b>. For me, the biggest problem is that when 
    the quadric surface does not match the actual geometry complexity, it will discard pixels where geometry is actually present. This artifact 
    was a deal breaker for me, so I entirely scratched the idea of approximating the surface curvature.
</p>

<p>
    Besides, the parallax effect is good enough when the displacement is small, which is always going to be the case when using parallax.
    For more intense displacement factors, tessellation is preferred because it provides more accurate shadows, perfect silhouettes 
    and no aliasing.
